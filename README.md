calculator
==========

I was wondering how hard it would be to write a web-based calculator after reading about how “easy” it would
purportedly be in [HyperCard](http://www.loper-os.org/?p=568), which refers to the HTML/Javascript/CSS stack as 
(and I quote) a “shit soup”. (Whatever. I agree with the rest of the article.)

I don’t think the amount of code that went into this app is that much different in quality or quantity to what went
into the HyperCard equivalent in the article above. HyperTalk looks quite nice at first blush, but one should never
assume a programming language is as nice as it looks until they’ve programmed something significant in it!
